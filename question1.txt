*Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2*

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is a protocol for transferring data over the web.
HTTP is a "client-server protocol", which means that it involves communication between a client (such as a web browser or mobile app) and a server (which hosts the website or web application). 
The client sends an HTTP request to the server, which then the server sends an HTTP response back to the client.  
 Web client - web browsers & applications.
 Web servers - websites & servers.
From the release of HTTP1.1 in 1997 until recently, there have been few revisions to the protocol. 
But in 2015, a reimagined version called HTTP2 came into use.
There have been several versions of the HTTP protocol, including HTTP 1.0, HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.

 But now we sare going to see the Difference between HTTP1.1 & HTTP2 :

HTTP1.1 :
HTTP 1 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 1) is the original version of the HTTP protocol, which is used for communication between web servers and clients, such as web browsers.
HTTP 1.0 was introduced in 1996, and HTTP 1.1 was introduced in 1999.

Here are some benefits of HTTP 1.1:
* Persistent connections
* Pipelining
* Caching
* Chunked transfer encoding
* Improved error handling

LIMITATIONS of HTTP1.1 :
* Lack of multiplexing
* Header inefficiency
* Inability to prioritize requests
* No support for server push

To resolve these limitations HTTP2 was introduced.

HTTP2 :
HTTP/2 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2) is an updated version of the HTTP protocol, which was introduced in 2015. 
It was designed to address some of the limitations and performance issues of HTTP/1.1 and improve the speed and efficiency of web communication.
Limitations like multiplexing,severe push , prioritizing in HTTP1.1 were resolved in HTTP2

Features ;
* Multiplexing
* Binary protocol
* Header compression
* Prioritization

This upgraded version also has some limitations like ;
*Implementation complexity
*Server resource consumption
*Security concerns
*Performance limitations

OVERALL:

Whereas HTTP1.1 addressed some of the limitations of HTTP/1.0 by introducing features such as "persistent connections, pipelining, and improved caching" ,
  it still had some limitations, such as head-of-line blocking and the inability to efficiently handle large numbers of small requests.
To resolve this limitations only HTTP2 was introduced with upgraded features.
Whenever a version comes there will be benefits and there will be limitations there , so a new set of versions will enter into market all the time.
